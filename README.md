BaytesInference.jl is an experimental library used for plotting and inference of [Baytes.jl](https://github.com/paschermayr/Baytes.jl) output. This package does not yet have a dedicated testing environment. The main use case is for other researchers to reproduce inference tables and plots used in my papers. I am open to implement further inference techniques if something cannot be structured within Baytes.jl or would need additional libraries with large dependencies.

## Going Forward

This package is still highly experimental - suggestions and comments are always welcome!
